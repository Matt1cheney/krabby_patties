## a little about the project
Come and enjoy a good Ol' Krabby Patty any way you like! Just type in the type of burger you would like, be creative!  This application allows the user to type in a value(burger) in the input field and then the application grabs the value and displays it in the left column. when the user selects the "eat me" button the application uses truthy falsey logic to determine if the burger has been eaten and then shows it to the right hand side of the application as eaten. the user also has the option to delete the burger as well.
